#ShapeCalculator

Input one of the supported shapes and any measurements needed and this program will output the body (area, volume) and the boundary (perimeter, surface area) of that shape for thse measurements.

Made to be pretty modular and fast to add more shapes too, but I think there might be some more ways to make it even easier.

I tried with Activator.CreateInstance but ran into issues where it wouldn't find the Type in my assembly when converting from an input string.
